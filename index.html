<h1>Graphic design is more neutral than any other product of society.</h1>
<h2><span class="highlight">More than that, as an arm of Western cultural development</span>, it is implicitly a function of neocolonialism and all that it has engendered. </h2>

<h3>When Paul Rand declared that design and social issues be kept separate, his statement implied that aesthetic judgements were akin to universal truths that form in a vacuum. </h3>

<h4>Ignoring the social context that informs aesthetic choices, and the political role of art and culture, exemplifies a privilege of whiteness — a privilege that enables the white person as the voice of authority.</h4>

<h5>Having donned that mantel of authority, designers can then dictate the terms of design and the experience of design:</h5>

<h6>Even if it is true that the average man seems most comfortable with the commonplace and familiar, <span class="space">it is equally true that catering to bad taste</span>,</h6>

<p>which we so readily attribute to the average reader, merely perpetuates the mediocrity and denies the reader one of the most easily accessible means for esthetic development and eventual enjoyment.</p>
